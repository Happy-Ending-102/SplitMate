# SplitMate

**SplitMate** is a desktop application to help friends and groups share expenses, track debts, and settle up seamlessly. It combines a JavaFX-based user interface with a Spring Boot back-end and MongoDB for persistence.

## üöÄ Core Features

- **User Profiles**

  - Each user has a name, avatar (Base64-encoded or default placeholder), and a list of balances in multiple currencies.
  - Bi-directional friendships: add friends, view mutual groups, and track shared expenses.
- **Group Management**

  - Create groups with a name, avatar, default currency and conversion policy.
  - Browse group transaction history and member debts.
- **Expense & Payment Tracking**

  - Log individual expenses or payments between group members.
  - Notifications for incoming payments or friend requests.
  - View per-user balances and transaction history sorted by date.
- **Automatic Debt Settlement**

  - Our application uses linear programming to compute minimal transfers that settle all balances.
  - Converts multi-currency balances into Turkish Lira (TL) for calculation, then persists the optimized ‚Äúwho owes whom‚Äù debts back into MongoDB.

## üèó Architecture

- **Frontend**:
  - JavaFX for UI, FXML for layouts (or code-based scenes), controllers wired via Spring.
- **Backend**:
  - Spring Boot with Spring Data MongoDB, services for Users, Groups, Friendships, Payments, Notifications, and Debt calculations.
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB (local or Atlas), storing documents for Users, Groups, Friendships, Transactions, Debts, etc.
- **Solver**:
  - Python 3 + PuLP for optimal debt settlement, communicated over stdin/stdout JSON.
